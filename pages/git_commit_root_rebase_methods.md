### Method :: 1

To change the author name and message of a specific commit (in this case, the first commit `24xxxxxxx_commit_hash`), you can use interactive rebase in Git. Here's how to do it via the VS Code or gitbase terminal:

### Steps to Change Author Name and Message:

1. **Start an Interactive Rebase**:
   Open the VS Code terminal and run the following command. This will initiate a rebase for the first three commits:

```bash
git rebase -i --root
```

2. **Modify the Rebase File**:
   An editor will open showing a list of your commits. It will look something like this:

   ```plaintext
   pick 24xxxxx Create VSCodeSettings repository initial commit
   pick e8xxxxx Revert "Create VSCodeSettings repository initial commit"
   pick 4axxxxx VSCodeSettings respository initial commit
   ```

   Change the word `pick` to `edit` for the commit `24xxxx` to edit it:

   ```plaintext
   edit 24xxxxx Create VSCodeSettings repository initial commit
   pick e8xxxxx Revert "Create VSCodeSettings repository initial commit"
   pick 4axxxxx VSCodeSettings respository initial commit
   ```

3. **Rewriting the Commit**:
   After saving and closing the editor, Git will pause the rebase at the commit you want to edit (`2473fbc`). Now, change the commit message and author name by running these commands:

   - To change the commit message:

     ```bash
     git commit --amend -m "New commit message here"
     ```

   - To change the author information:
     ```bash
     git commit --amend --author="Apurv <apurv@example.com>"
     ```

4. **Continue the Rebase**:
   After making your changes, continue the rebase by running:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

   If there are no conflicts, Git will finish the rebase.

5. **Force Push the Changes**:
   Since you've rewritten the commit history, you'll need to force-push the changes to your repository:

   ```bash
     git push origin main --force-with-lease
     or
     git push --force-with-lease
     or
     git push --force
   ```

Now the commit `commit_hash_code` will have the updated author name and commit message.

Let's go through a more detailed and structured approach to resolve this issue. Since you have already tried several methods without success, I will provide an alternative way that focuses on resolving potential rebase issues and changing the commit author.

We’ll attempt to change the author of the specific commit (`7e932ead91d3a5158b14b8d6e70b15196ce99e14`) by using `filter-branch`, which allows you to rewrite history in a more flexible way, or another method, `rebase -i` with a different approach.

### Method 2: Using `git rebase -i HEAD~N` Approach

If the previous rebase method didn’t work, let’s try to modify the specific commit using the `HEAD~N` approach. Here’s a refined approach to ensure the commit is properly targeted.

#### Steps:

1. **Find the commit in your history**
   Run:

   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

   Locate the commit `7e932ead91d3a5158b14b8d6e70b15196ce99e14` and count how many commits it is from the `HEAD`. Let's say it's 5 commits back.

2. **Run rebase on the last 5 commits**
   Assuming the commit you want to modify is 5 commits back from the `HEAD`, use:

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~5
   ```

3. **Edit the commit**
   Once the interactive editor opens, find the commit with the hash `7e932ead91d3a5158b14b8d6e70b15196ce99e14` and replace `pick` with `edit`.

   For example, if the list looks like this:

   ```
   pick 7e932ead91d3a5158b14b8d6e70b15196ce99e14 Your commit message here
   pick abc123 Another commit
   pick def456 Another commit
   ```

   Change it to:

   ```
   edit 7e932ead91d3a5158b14b8d6e70b15196ce99e14 Your commit message here
   ```

4. **Amend the commit with the new author**
   Now that Git has stopped at the commit, amend the author details:

   ```bash
   git commit --amend --author="Apurv <apurv@example.com>"
   ```

5. **Continue the rebase**
   Run:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

6. **Force-push the changes**
   Finally, force-push the changes:
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

---

### Method 3: Using `git filter-branch`

If the interactive rebase approach still doesn’t work, use `git filter-branch` to change the author of the specific commit.

#### Steps:

1. **Use the filter-branch command to change the author of a specific commit:**
   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   git filter-branch --env-filter '
   if [ "$GIT_COMMIT" = "7e932ead91d3a5158b14b8d6e70b15196ce99e14" ]; then
       export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Apurv"
       export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="apurv@example.com"
       export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="Apurv"
       export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="apurv@example.com"
   fi
   ' -- --all
   ```

   This will change the author of only the specific commit with the hash `7e932ead91d3a5158b14b8d6e70b15196ce99e14` without affecting other commits.

2. **Force-push the changes**
   After running `git filter-branch`, you need to force-push the changes:
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

---

### Method 4: Using `git reset` and cherry-pick

If all else fails, we can do a hard reset to the commit before the one you want to change and then cherry-pick the commits, modifying the author as needed.

#### Steps:

1. **Reset the branch to one commit before the target commit**
   Run:

   ```bash
   git reset --soft 7e932ead91d3a5158b14b8d6e70b15196ce99e14^
   ```

   This resets your branch to the commit **before** the one you want to change, but it keeps your changes in the working directory.

2. **Commit with the new author details**
   Re-commit the changes with the new author:

   ```bash
   git commit --author="Apurv <apurv@example.com>" -m "Your original commit message"
   ```

3. **Reapply any other commits if needed**
   If there were other commits after the one you changed, you can reapply them using `git cherry-pick`. For example:

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick abc123  # replace abc123 with the commit hash you want to reapply
   ```

4. **Force-push the changes**
   Finally, force-push the changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```
